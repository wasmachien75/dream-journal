            <p class="description">M. invites me to her wedding. I am together with my brothers and mom in some strange
               house. L. wants me to go shopping for him. I get angry, I'm working from home. Discussed
               with C. that my work can't be done that easily.</p>

            <p class="description">Family gathering. Many people, crowded even. Running around. I lost my shoe. I lost
               my pants. I feel ashamed. I lost a card game. My little sister won everything. I See
               my grandmother, in her old house, celebrating New Year in the summer.</p>

            <p class="description">Back in Moscow, the school. What a hellhole. Shook hands with the head teacher, the
               witch. Mass gathering of students. Covid scares. I want to get out of here. Got a
               message from my Russian friend. I probably didn't answer.</p>
