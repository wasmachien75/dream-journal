            <p class="description">On a bike,in the dark. It's some kind of game. I see dead people next to the road.
               I'm in L. I meet with K., an old classmate. We're in love. We have no place to meet.
               I then go to dark-haired T., who is sitting at a table outside. She's accompanied
               by her boyfriend. Too bad. She is cold and they decide to walk away. I go back home.
               My bike breaks. My phone screen is shattered. I've accidentally changed the pin number.
               I enter an underground bar with my bike. The back door says bikes are not allowed.
               Luckily, the bartender doesn't seem to care.</p>

            <p class="description">Played a video game with my brothers. I had invited them to my lonely apartment near
               the sea. I did my best not to make them bored. Did we lose H.? L. came back to work.
               I'm happy.</p>

            <p class="description">M. invites me to her wedding. I am together with my brothers and mom in some strange
               house. L. wants me to go shopping for him. I get angry, I'm working from home. Discussed
               with C. that my work can't be done that easily.</p>

            <p class="description">Family gathering. Many people, crowded even. Running around. I lost my shoe. I lost
               my pants. I feel ashamed. I lost a card game. My little sister won everything. I See
               my grandmother, in her old house, celebrating New Year in the summer.</p>

            <p class="description">Back in Moscow, the school. What a hellhole. Shook hands with the head teacher, the
               witch. Mass gathering of students. Covid scares. I want to get out of here. Got a
               message from my Russian friend. I probably didn't answer.</p>
