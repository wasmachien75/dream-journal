      Back in Moscow, the school. What a hellhole. Shook hands with the head teacher, the witch. Mass gathering of students.
      Covid scares. I want to get out of here. 
      Got a message from my Russian friend. I probably didn't answer.

     Family gathering. Many people, crowded even. Running around. I lost my shoe. I lost my pants. I feel ashamed. I lost a card game. My little sister won everything.
     I See my grandmother, in her old house, celebrating New Year in the summer.

      M. invites me to her wedding. I am together with my brothers and mom in some strange house. L. wants me to go shopping for him. I get angry,
      I'm working from home. Discussed with C. that my work can't be done that easily.
