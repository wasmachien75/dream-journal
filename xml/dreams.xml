    <description> Back in Moscow, the school. What a hellhole. Shook hands with the head teacher, the witch. Mass gathering of students. Covid scares. I want to get out of here. Got a message from my
      Russian friend. I probably didn't answer. </description>

    <description> Family gathering. Many people, crowded even. Running around. I lost my shoe. I lost my pants. I feel ashamed. I lost a card game. My little sister won everything. I See my
      grandmother, in her old house, celebrating New Year in the summer. </description>

    <description>On a bike,in the dark. It's some kind of game. I see dead people next to the road. I'm in L. I meet with K., an old classmate. We're in love. We have no place to meet. I then go to
      dark-haired T., who is sitting at a table outside. She's accompanied by her boyfriend. Too bad. She is cold and they decide to walk away. I go back home. My bike breaks. My phone screen is
      shattered. I've accidentally changed the pin number. I enter an underground bar with my bike. The back door says bikes are not allowed. Luckily, the bartender doesn't seem to care.

    <description>I am at work. We are running towards a bus stop. A lot of us were tired afterwards. I talk to H. and K. I hope the latter can explain why nothing is working. I am wearing light
      colored pants.</description>

    <description>A beautiful, large hotel by the seaside. Somebody is getting married. I feel confused and out of place. I want to go for a walk on the beach. Quickly, before the sun goes down. My
      family is there. So are my colleagues. They are looking for a room. </description>

    <description>At school. Getting in a classroom with colleagues. S. forces me to buy gifts for my brothers. I am lying on the floor. There is some kind of party I don't care about. I am trading my

    <description>Running home from the football club. My endurance is endless. I run so fast. I never knew how much I like running. There was a festival going on where I was with my brothers...I am
      now far from home. I support those that didn't make it, as we go up the stairs. We switched rooms, but I forgot to take my glasses with me. They were broken. I hope the hotel staff managed to
      find them. </description>

    <description>I am in a cave. Abroad, on a university assignment. We need to find our way out of it. We have books that should help us. They contain maps. I see other people solving the same puzzle. I get three hours to find the exit. I feel confident. It's my old professor W. who leads the class.</description>

    <description>In Moscow. In a shop underground, near the metro entrance. I suddenly realize I'm not wearing my face mask and quickly put it on. Then it comes. A flood of people coming in, heading towards the subway.
    They are not wearing masks. This is not good. We need to go. I wonder if it's better to wait, but then I realize Moscow is always busy. Waiting at the entrance restaurant now. We reserved places, but apparently I didn't. They're looking at me. Can't you just add a chair?

    <description>With my father in a gym. The gym is pretty much empty. The equipment looks old and beat up. The subscription fee is high, but we're here on a trial. 
    People are coming in. I want to get on a treadmill, but they're all taken. I settle for some weird machine that goes up and down. There is also a swimming pool in the middle. Outside
      there is a movie theatre. I think we're going to watch one. Did I forget something in the gym?
